# Introduction to Programming
## Computer Instructions
- A computer doesn't understand code like humans do.
- It understands basic instructions called machine code
- a computer's CPU handles its instructions and calculations.
    - Machine code is a language that enables fast execution it can be regarded as the lowest level source code.
## What is Programming?
- Programs = Programs are lists of instructions the computer performs in sequential order. They typically include mathmeatical operations.
- Source Code = A program written in a high-level programming language
    - A programming language includes a set of instructions that yield various types of results.
## What is Python?
- A high-level programming language
- Easy to deploy and learn
- Python's design emphasizes code readability
    - Python is not meant for low-level programming.
## Python vs. Other Languages
- Python = easy to learn, works in any environemnt, many libraries, large community, syntax is easy to learn, many frameworks
- C# = hard to learn, works in specific environments, .NET libraries, large community, syntax is difficult to learn, .NET framework
- Java = Hard to learn, works in any environment, few libraries, large community, syntax is difficult to learn, many frameworks.
## Python Interpreter
- Python is an interpreter lamguage
- Reads instructions from top to bottom and left to right, w/ exceptions
- Performs instruction validation
- Results are returned per instruction, in sequential order.
    - the interpreter can be run from within CLI using the py command or installed in the IDE.
## Compiler vs. Interpreter
- Compiler = It takes more time to compile; however, the code execution is faster, the code is compiled for a specific operating system, the source code is typically unavaolable, and the compiled data can be read, once the binary is compiled, the source code is no longer needed.
- Interpreter = Execution takes more time, and each instruction must be compiled in real time, code can be executed in any environment that includes the interpreter, the source code is available and readable, the code is needed each time the program is executed.
## Python 2 vs. Python 3
- Python 2 = python 2 code is considered legacy code, many older libraries built for python 2 are not-forward compatible, strings are stored in ASCII characters by default, calculations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Print "Hello"
- Python 3 = Python 3 replaced 2 at the beginning of 2020, most new libraries are being developed strictly for use with python 3, strings are stored as unicode characters by default, calculations are not automatically rounded. Print("Hello")
## Python Types
- CPython = is the original implementation of python
- Jython = is an implementation ofpython designed to run on the java platform.
- Ironpython = an implementation of python that can be integrated into the .NET framework.
# Python Installation
## Python in CLI 
- running the pyton CLI interpreter in windows is done using the CMD, by adding python to the path.
- Running either py or python3 launches the interpreter.
# Python IDE
## Working w/ IDE
- Integrated development environment
- a program dedicated to specific software developments
- IDE is easier to use than CLI
- Includes many ueful tools for software development
    - One of the most useful IDE programs is PyCharm, which is used for Python programming.
## IDLE 
- Pythons integrated development and learning environment ( IDLE )
- IDLE has two main windows: one for Shgell and other for editing
- IDLE is a cross-platform that works on windows, UNIX, and macOS
# Python Environment & PyCharm
## New Project
- During development, treat a program like a project.
- Projects help organize files and create a dedicated environment
- Projects are created using the New Project option
## PyCharm Settings
- pycharm visual themes can be extensively configured
- Most default settings can be left as is, but some require selection
## Interpreter Configuration
- PyCharm allows selection of different interpreters for different projects
- Python installation should be automatically detected
- Configuration is done via Settings > Project Interpreter
## PyCharm Virtual Environment 
- PyCharm allows virtual environment tools to create isolated projects 
- the purpose of a virtual environment is to manage all project settings
- Virtual environment creation is relatively easy.
## PyCharm Code Execution
- PyCharm has several ways to execute code.
- After execution, the console will appear with the results and errors
- The console informs the developer if there are mistakes in the code
# Basic Syntax
## Python Data Types
- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
## Python Syntax
- a hashtag (#) renders an entire line as a comment
- Three quotations marks ("") are used in the beginning and end of multi-line comments
- Three quotation marks can be used in print() to print multi-line strings.
## Standard Syntax Prinicples
- Most programming languages are case-sensitive
- statements must be fully written
- Case-sensitive means that x is not the same as X, and John is not john
## Code Handling
- Whitespace = invisible characters that make the code more readable
- Keyworkds = Pythons reserved words and instructions
- Indentation = a mechansism that associates a block of code with a condition, loop, or class.
