# Variables & User Input
## Variables
- Constructed of a name and value
- They can be thought of as data containers
- Variables are used to store data for reference and manipulation in computer programs.
## Variable Types
- varSTR = "value"
- VarINT = 5
- varFLOAT = 1.75
- python will automatically detect the data type
- The syntax varies depending on the data type
- A variable name must begin with a letter or underscore
- myString = "this is a string"
- print(myString)
- >> this is a string

- myNum = 48
- print(myNum)
- >> 48

- myBool = True
- print(myBool)
- >> True

- myFloat = 1.75
- print(myfloat)
- >> 1.75
# Advanced Data Structures
- A data structure is a method of organizing and storing data so that it can easily be accessed and acted upon.
- Strcutures define data associations and the operations that can be performed on each type of data.
    - Data structures in Python include dictionary, tuple, and list.
## List
- A Versatile and dynamic data type
- Can hold different types of data simultaneously
- The values are numerically indexed starting at 0.
## List Manipulation
- The lists indexes are used for manipulation
- Update/add value:
listName[index ]= newValue
- Delate value:
def listName[index ]
- Two additional ways to change lists are with append() and remove().
- append() adds values to the end of the list.
- Remove() removes values from the list.
## Tuple
- Immutable sequence of python objects
- read-only and cannot be edited.
- tuples are created simply by writing values serparated by commas.
## Dicitionary
- a python dicitionary is a collection of items
- items in the dicitionary have a key:value format
- Dicitionaries are identified by curly brackets
## Dictionary Manipulation
- A dictionary can be updated
- the name and a new value of an item are specified for updates.
- Del is used with an items name for deletion.
## Nested Data Structures 
- Data structures can hold other data structures.
- the example on the right shows a list with a nested tuple.
- they can be manipulated the same way as basic structures.
# String Manipulation
- a python data type
- identified by " "
- a collection of indexed characters
- can be manipulated using various methods
## String Concatenation
- mulitple strings can be aggregated to a single string
- it is performed by using the + operator
- other data types cannot be added to a string
## String Sub-String
- also known as slicing.
- allows you to slice specific characters from a string.
- the slicing structure is 
string[start:end:step]
## String to List
- Separation of a string into a collection of words
- Split() separates a string and arranges it as a list.
- the splitting point can be specified in the function.
