# For & While Loops
- Loops are blocks of code that run as long as a condition is true.
- They allow repeating code logic for as long as the condition is true.
## For Loops
- Perform blocks of code if the condiiton is true.
- a for loop provides iterating capabiltiies.
- Can iterate over lists, defined ranges, and more
## Range vs. List in Loops
- List iteration allows printing data.
- A set range, defined by range(), is also capable of iteration
- A variable is defined within the loop as the iterating item.
## Calculate Loop Size
- The len() function returns the number of items of an object.
- the range() function accepts an integer and returns the range of the object.
