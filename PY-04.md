# Error Handling
- Python programs may encounter errors and raise execpetions.
- If not handled, the program stops and presents an error.
- Error handling can prevent a crash and allow the script to contiune functioning
## Try & Except
- Error messages explain ther eason for a crash
- try = creates a code block to execute code that may create an error.
- except = handles the error in the try code
## Common Exception Types
- Exception = Base class for all exceptions
- Stopiteration = Stops the next() iterator from continuning
- SystemExit = Raised by the sys.exit() function
- ArithmeticError = Occurs for numeric calculations
- ZeroDivisionError = Division or modulo by zero
- TypeError = Applies an operation to mismatched data types
- KeyboardInterrupt = Generated by programmer/user
## Error Handling Loops
- Exception as error = Inserts an error message in a variable
- Raise = Prints a custom error message
- Else = runs only if no exception occurred
- Finally = Runs whether the code failed or succeeded]
# File Manipulation
## Python & Files
- python inclludes several built-in modules and functions for file handling
- in python, a file is categorized as either text ( character sequence) or binary.
- binary files are processed only by applications that work w/ the binary structure
## File Access Modes
- r = opens a file for reading only
- b = opens a file in binary format
- a = opens a file for appending; creates a new file if it does not exist
- w = opens a file for writing only and overwrites the existing file
- + = adds a read or write operation depending on the one selected
## Opening Files
- The open() functiion enables access to a file for the python interpreter.
- the open() function requires a file name and access mode.
- the close() function must be added after open to be able to read the file and/or save changes made.
## Writing to Files
- The write() function writes content to an open file
- Content can be written only if the file was opened in the appropriate mode
- read-only access raises an exception when write is used
## Reading Files
- The read() function allows reading the file according to the permission
- the readline() function is used to read a file line by line
- The readline([bytes]) function can be used to read the number of bytes from the line
## Closing Files
- After writing to a file, it is important to close it
- Not closing a file may cause a program to behave unexpectedly.
- the close() function saves and closes a file
## Flush
- the flush() function is used to save a file and continue ediiting it
- the file is saved in the system but remains open
## With Open Statement
- A with statement will create a context manager
- the open() function sets a new variable to handle the file
- the variable that contains the file is the one defined after as.
**Note** = we also put import os on top of the code
