# Intro to Functions
- Functions are necessary to prevent code from becoming difficult to understand.
- They save the time and effort of having to write the same functional code in different parts of a program
- they also make code maintenance more efficient
## What are Functions?
- Blocks of code w/ reusable logic
- Define functionality in the program
- Separate programs into small, readable, and manageable sections
    - functions are not parts of other elements in a script. Methods are functions that are parts of other elements in a script.
## Function Declaration
- a function must be defined first w/ the def keyword
- after def, the name of the function is provided.
- the last part is parentheses() for optional parameters and a colon : to the code block.
## Invoking a Function
- a defined function will not yet be executed by python
- it must first be invoked before it can be userd
- functions can also accept parameters.
## Default Values
- Function parameters can include default values
- if no value is passed, the default value will be used
- if a value is passed, the default value will be overridden.
## Returning Values
- Functions can pass data at the end of the execution
- the return keyword is used to pass the values
- return also terminates the execution of a functiion.
## Returning Data
- a function can return multiple values, a list, or a dictionary
- each type of returned information is placed in separate parentheses
- Commas are used to separate the values
## Complete Function Example
- def defines a function
- the function name w/ parentheses will set the parameters
- return ends the execution and returns the results
## None
- none is not a value and refers to empty data
- it cannot be used in expressions but can be inserted in a variable or compared w/ them.
- Every function by default returns a none value
# Cdde Handling
## Scope
- scope is what defines the visibility of a variable
- a variable in a function is accessible only in that function
- there are four types of scope: local, enclosed, global, and built-in.
## Global Scope
- global scope is the main scope of a program
- variables defined in a global scope will be recognized in all other scopes as well
## Global Keyword
- the global keyword is used to modify a global variable within a function in which a variable of the same name exist.
- it instructs python to use the variable from the global scope
## __name__ Variable
- every python file has the __ name __ variable
- it returns a different result depending on the execution state of a file
- the variable can be used to cehck if a file was imported
## Proper Code Management
- import should be at the beginning of a program
- global variables should follow imports
- __ name __ == '__ main __ ' should be written at the end of the file
# Recursion
- Functions that call themselves
- provide a way of looping through data
- must be handled carefully to prevent endless execution
## Recursion Implemenation
- Recursion is implemented by having a function call itself repeatedly
- It should be handled carefully to prevent endless loops
- we need a base case
- it counts down until our count number , example

# Object-Oriented Programming
- Objects are complex data types that contain attributes and functionalities
- They provide the flexibility of creating custom strctured data.
## Class
- a class is a blueprint for an object
- it defines an objects properties
- when a program is run, a class is the blueprint used to create objects in the system's memory
## Defining a Class
- class = followed by the name of the class and a colon
- __ init__ = allows the attributes of a class to be initialized for an object
- class attributes and methods are accessed using self

## Object Creation
- Call the class by its name w/ a value corresponding to __ init__
- use < object name >. < attribute > to access object attributes
